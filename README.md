## 1. Basic Principles of DNA Extraction

DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) or RNA (RiboNucleic Acid) extraction process basically a process that involves disruption of tissue to and breaking of the cell wall, cell and nuclear membranes to release the DNA/RNA and then isolating the nucleic acid from the rest of the unwanted cell debris. 

We are using the **Qiagen DNeasy Plant Pro Kit** and a **modified CTAB protocol** to extract genomic DNA from plant tissues.  
Here is a simple overview of the basic principles and science behind DNA extraction:

DNA extraction is the process of isolating DNA from cells or tissues. In plants, this involves:
1. **Sample homogenization and cell lysis** – breaking the tough plant cell wall (often using grinding with liquid nitrogen or bead beating), and using detergents and buffers to dissolve cell membranes and release DNA into solution (lysis).
2. **Removal of contaminants** – separating DNA from proteins, polysaccharides, and other cellular components (centrifugation).
4. **DNA precipitation/binding and cleaning** – capturing DNA on a solid support (e.g., silica column) or with alcohol precipitation.
5. **Elution** – washing and releasing purified DNA into a clean solution for downstream applications. Then concentration of DNA and purity are measured.
6. **Storage** - Store DNA at **–20 °C** for long-term use or **4 °C** for short-term use.

## 2. Protocol: Qiagen DNeasy Plant Pro Kit
**Kit:** Qiagen DNeasy Plant Pro Kit  

### Materials
- **DNeasy Plant Pro Kit** (Qiagen, Cat. No. 69204 or 69206)  
- Mortar and pestle or bead mill  
- Liquid nitrogen  
- Microcentrifuge capable of ≥20,000 × g  
- Pipettes and sterile tips  
- 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes  
- Nuclease-free water (provided in kit or equivalent)  
- Vortex mixer  

---

### 1. Sample Preparation
1. Collect fresh or frozen plant tissue (~50 mg fresh or ~20 mg dry weight).  
2. Freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen.  
3. Grind thoroughly to a fine powder using a pre-chilled mortar and pestle or bead mill.

---

### 2. Cell Lysis
1. Transfer the powdered tissue to a 2 mL bead beating tube from the kit.  
2. Add **800 µL Buffer CD1** (lysis buffer).  
3. Secure the tube and bead-beat or vortex vigorously for **10 minutes** to lyse cells.

### 3. Lysate Clarification
1. Centrifuge at **15,000 × g for 2 minutes**.  
2. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean 2 mL tube, avoiding the debris pellet.

---

### 4. DNA Binding
1. Add **600 µL Buffer CD2** to the supernatant and mix by inverting 5–6 times.  
2. Centrifuge at **15,000 × g for 1 minute**.  
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.  
4. Add **1.5 volumes Buffer CD3** (binding buffer) and mix by pipetting.  
5. Transfer up to **650 µL** of the mixture into the **MB Spin Column** (provided).  
6. Centrifuge at **15,000 × g for 1 minute** and discard the flow-through.  
7. Repeat until all mixture has been loaded and passed through the column.

### 5. Column Wash
1. Add **500 µL Buffer CQ** (wash buffer) to the column.  
2. Centrifuge at **15,000 × g for 1 minute**; discard flow-through.  
3. Repeat once more with **500 µL Buffer CQ**.

### 6. DNA Elution
1. Place the column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  
2. Add **100 µL pre-warmed (65 °C) nuclease-free water** directly to the membrane.  
3. Incubate for **5 minutes** at room temperature.  
4. Centrifuge at **15,000 × g for 1 minute** to elute DNA.

### Storage
- Store DNA at **–20 °C** for long-term use or **4 °C** for short-term use.

### Notes
- The bead beating step is critical for complete lysis of tough plant cells.  
- Avoid overloading columns, as this can reduce yield and purity.  
- Verify DNA concentration and purity using a Nanodrop or Qubit.
